## 🧠 What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a dynamic, high-level programming language used to create interactive and dynamic content in web applications. It runs in the browser and on the server (via Node.js), supporting object-oriented, functional, and event-driven programming styles.

## 🚀 How to Run the Code

You can run each JavaScript file using the browser:

1. Open the `index.html` file.
2. Edit the `<script>` tag to point to your desired `.js` file. Example:

```html
<script src="Arguments Optional.js"></script>
